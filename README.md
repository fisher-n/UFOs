# Overview of Analysis
The purpose of this analysis was to create an user friendly web site for a client that presents UFO sightings data for people searching for more information on the topic. 

## Results
Users are able to filter results by entering their search criteria on the left which will display a table with thier results on the left side of the page. Based on what they are looking for they can enter either a single criteria or multiple factors to get their results. 

## Summary
One drawback of this page is that it is limited to the dataset that we were given by the client. Since this data has been collected there have been many more UFO sightings and confirmation from NASA of these sightings. A drawback of this page is that there are no individual buttons for the user to click once they have entered their search criteria which is not very user friendly. For further imporvement, I would recommend adding indivdual buttons to make the page easier for some users and also create a way to consistently update the information on the page as more sighting happen.
